# How to build?
This project uses cmake as its build system. There are no extra parameters for building for linux.

In case you would like to cross compile for windows, use the windows-toolchain.cmake file.
Do not run the build.sh file as it is for debugging.

## Tests?

Currently, the testing system is being worked on.
